You don\u0027t have to know everything, you just have to know enough to bullshit your way through life. Bullshitting people that you get it, you understand what they say, their feelings and even their unspoken thoughts, that you can connect with them even though you don\u0027t.\n\nBullshitting yourself that this is your design, that you are in control, that your beliefs are your beliefs not just some bullshit fed to, that you are genuine not just another broken record of the same screams and dreams. Whether through genetics or religion, you can convince yourself that something is actually true, justify whatever you need to your mind, create whatever meaning you want.\nYou just have to know enough to bullshit yourself.👍",
